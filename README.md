# Drone_Control_and_Navigation

This project is part of the ENPM667 - Control for Robotics Systems course at the University of Maryland. Here, we were tasked to replicate the results of a research paper focused on control systems.

In our project we replicated the paper titled "A novel potential field controller for use on aerial robots." Here, we developed and comapred the performance of Potential Field Controller (PFC) and extended Potential Field Controller (ePFC) on an aerial robot (ARDrone).
